If you’ve popped into any of our workshops and enjoyed it and would like to see more in the future, we'd ask you to become an official supporting member of TinkerSoc! The more members that sign up, the more funding from the Union we get, which equals more events including workshops and socials!

The membership for the whole year is <strong>£5 for Kent Students, and £7 for non-students</strong>. This membership fee covers many of our events entirely, including all of the talks. However, we may need to charge for certain kits and materials required to participate in workshops. Don’t worry though, we will make sure you know this well in advance and will try to keep the price for one workshop under £5 where possible.

To become a member, please follow these steps:
<ul>
	<li>Please sign up to the <a href="http://www.kentunion.co.uk/">Kent Union Website</a></li>
	<li>Make sure you're logged in, then go to our<a href="http://www.kentunion.co.uk/organisation/TinkerSoc/"> Group Page </a>and click Add to Basket on Standard Membership (if you're a Kent student) or Associate Membership if you're not a member of Kent Union.</li>
	<li>You should then see a Basket appear on the right hand side of the page.  You can add more memberships to other societies at this point should you wish!  When you're done, click Review Basket, and then Proceed to Checkout.</li>
	<li>You'll then be asked to pay via debit or credit card.</li>
</ul>
You’re now an Official TinkerSoc member!

<strong>IF YOU SEE ANY ERRORS DURING THE MEMBERSHIP PROCESS PLEASE LET US KNOW</strong>. The new Kent Union site we have to use to recruit members is rubbish, for lack of a better word so if it doesn't work for you <a href="/contact">please let us know</a> and we will do our best to rectify the situation.
