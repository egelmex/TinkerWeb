Hi Everyone,

Next week in the Sim Lab we are going to be holding our AGM and finishing off the work we've been doing.

During the AGM the committee candidates are going to tell you why you should vote for them, and you'll get a short run down of the year according toTinkerSoc. It's very important that you attend so that you have a say in who's representing you next year.

Important: If you wish to stand for election please go to <a href="http://www.kentunion.co.uk/societies/TinkerSoc/" target="_blank">http://www.kentunion.co.uk/<wbr>societies/TinkerSoc/</a> where you can nominate yourself - **the deadline is 5.00pm on Friday 23rd March**.

Cheers,

Matt
