<p>Fancy covering your friends in packing tape and clingfilm?</p>

<p>We'll be holding a tape sculpture workshop this Friday (13th February) in <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/ettoffice/rooms/Rutherford/RLT2/index.htm">RLT2 </a>at 1800-2000.  Hopefully, we're going to make some ... interesting ... sculptures.  We will be making the sculptures out of various things (including (consenting) humans), then putting LEDs in them, and "installing" them around campus.</p>

<p>You don't need to put your name down anywhere, just turn up!</p>

<p>We have enough clingfilm to cover a car park, so bring your (consenting) friends!</p>
