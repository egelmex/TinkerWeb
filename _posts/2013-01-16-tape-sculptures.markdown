We made tape sculptures this week, and aside from a slight shortage of tape it
was a great success, we now have a plastic, slightly flexible version of Matt..
well now I put it like that, it might not be such a great thing...

We first wrapped Matt in cling film, and then proceeded to cover him in tape,
he seemed to just about be able to breathe, so all seemed good. Perhaps we can
make him our mascot for ReFresher's fayre.
