The next TinkerSoc event is going be an OpenMic evening on Monday, 7 December in our usual place (KLSR4) starting at our usual time (18:00).

In OpenMic sessions we have short (~20mins max) slots for members to come and show the rest of the crowd cool stuff they have been working on or just stumbled upon. You can talk about anything you like or show random videos/pictures if you do not like talking. We want to see cool things!

Details and a list of talks can be found in <a href="http://tinkersoc.org/wiki/events:openmic3">our wiki</a>. Keep in mind people like last minute wiki-edits so you'll probably see more talks than the only one currently listed on the page. Also, please feel free to add your name to the list if you are planning to talk  :)
