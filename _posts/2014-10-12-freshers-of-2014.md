Welcome freshers and everyone else coming back to the society this year. We are so excited with the new year for Tinkersoc as the new makerspace is now built and ready for use! This means that making projects is so much easier with the new equipment avaliable to us. This is also the new place where tinkersoc will be at 7pm but like always will be meeting in the gulbenkian. We already have loads of exciting things planned for this year like key ring making, Bottle rockets, working with the basics of an Arduino and much MUCH more!
