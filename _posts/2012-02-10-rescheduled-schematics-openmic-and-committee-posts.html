Hi Everyone,

This weeks schematic design session has been rescheduled to this coming Monday (13th Feb), and as usual we will be in the Sim Lab in the Jennison building at 6.00pm.

The OpenMic session has also been pushed back to the Monday after (20th Feb), so you still have time to tell us if you want to speak.

Finally, a call for volunteers. Every society needs committee members, and all of the current committee are stepping down at the end of this year. Being on the committee isn't hard, it just requires that you care about the society. As well as the joy you get out of everything going well, it is something that really enhances your CV and the hours count towards the <a href="http://www.kentunionvolunteering.co.uk/">Kent Union volunteering scheme</a>. TinkerSoc needs committee members, and it helps you out too.

Cheers,

Matt
