# Re-Introduction to OrCAD Workshop #

Time: Friday 5th December, 2 PM

Location: [ELELT](http://www.kent.ac.uk/ettoffice/rooms/Electronics/EleLT/index.htm)

It's that time of the year again when people start building their circuits for their projects only to realize they can't remember a thing about OrCAD!


So, to help you remember the basics of schematic entry, footprint hunting and layout creation, Omer will be presenting a short (~1hr) demo of creating a PCB from scratch this Friday at 2PM in the Electronics Lecture theater.
