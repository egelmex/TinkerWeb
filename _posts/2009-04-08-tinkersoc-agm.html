The programme will be as follows:

The committee will have 4 roles:

If you wish to be a candidate for election to any of the above positions, then please email a manifesto explaining why you would like to take the position (can be a couple of sentences) to me (chris@ukctinker.org), and they will be added to the wiki and published before the AGM.  You'll also be given time in the AGM to state your position.
