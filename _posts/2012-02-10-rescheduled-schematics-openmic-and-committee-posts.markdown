Hi Everyone,

This weeks schematic design session has been rescheduled to this coming Monday
(13th Feb), and as usual we will be in the Sim Lab in the Jennison building at
6.00pm.

The OpenMic session has also been pushed back to the Monday after (20th Feb),
so you still have time to tell us if you want to speak.

Finally, a call for volunteers. Every society needs committee members, and all
of the current committee are stepping down at the end of this year. Being on
the committee isn't hard, it just requires that you care about the society. As
well as the joy you get out of everything going well, it is something that
really enhances your CV and the hours count towards the [Kent Union
volunteering scheme](http://www.kentunionvolunteering.co.uk). TinkerSoc needs
committee members, and it helps you out too.

Cheers,

Matt
