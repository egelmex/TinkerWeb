Hi Everyone,

First off, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TinkerSoc/status/175576055090913280/photo/1">hoodies</a> have arrived! I will bring the big box of hoodies to our session on Monday.

On Monday at 6.00pm we will be finishing off the LED glue stick clock and also working on another kit, the miniPOV.

If you want to make and keep a miniPOV the costs are going to be no more than last time (£5 for members, £10 for non-members), though may be lower.

See you on Monday!

Matt
