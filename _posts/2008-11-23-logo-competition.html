We are in desperate need of a cool new logo for our cool new society and as with everything we do, we want the logo to be a community project (community designed and chosen!)

If you fancy having a go at designing the logo that will be used on all society related stuff (posters, wearables, circuit boards, stickers etc), then take a look at the wiki page for the <a href="/wiki/logo/">logo competition</a> for information on how to submit your entry.  We will do a poll to choose the winner finishing on the 2nd February 2009.

<strong>Please make sure that you have your logo submitted before the 29th January 2009</strong>.

There will be a voting period before the winner is announced.

The winner will receive an electronics goodie bag!
