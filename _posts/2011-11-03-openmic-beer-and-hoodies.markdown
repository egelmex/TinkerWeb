## Next Week ##

This Monday at 6.00pm in KS14 we're hosting our second OpenMic of the year,
and we have a list of talks including topics such as a
home-made [Keytar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keytar),
a [MakerBot](http://www.makerbot.com/) and a computer controlled Lego
railway. If you were eager to talk about something, please tell us! We
always have room for an extra talk

## Coming weeks ##

The week after we are going to be holding a pub social, where we'll be
going to be taking you to a couple of our favourite pubs in town.

## Other stuff ##

Hoodies! So far we only have a few hoodie orders, if you want one get your
order in as soon as possible! Go to our
page [here](http://www.kentunion.co.uk/organisation/TinkerSoc/) to order,
and then to [this form](http://goo.gl/Z8l9e) tell me how you want it
personalised.
