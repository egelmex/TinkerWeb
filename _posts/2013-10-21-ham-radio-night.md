Following the talk and practical session by the [Hilderstone Amateur Radio and Electronics club](http://www.g0hrs.org/pages/go.php) on Wednesday, we went to the Monkton Nature reserve (Sunday 20th October). There we erected our own portable antennae and did various practical tasks that are required for the [Foundation licence](http://rsgb.org/main/clubs-and-education/for-students/foundation/).

The first group erected an antenna to be tuned to the 40 meter band and the second group erected a larger one to be tuned to the 80 meter band. Both antennae needed to be setup in such a way that they would not interfere with each other. Once setup, the groups found that the airways were very busy as a worldwide competition was being held, but over the course of a few hours they successfully completed the practical requirements of the foundation license (one group even spoke to [GB4RS](http://www.qrz.com/db/GB4RS) â€“ the licensing body's call sign!).
