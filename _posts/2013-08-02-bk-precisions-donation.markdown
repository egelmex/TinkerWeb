<a href="http://www.bkprecision.com/">B&amp;K Precision</a> have kindly donated some awesome kit to TinkerSoc all the way from America. We will be teaching you how to use this equipment in our headphone amp project (more details of which will be announced in the new term), and then they will be available for members to use.

We would like to send our warmest thanks to <a href="http://www.bkprecision.com/">B&amp;K Precision</a> as we would never have been able to afford such awesome equipment from our budget.
