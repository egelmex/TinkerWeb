Hi Everyone,

Now it's finally time to unleash our greatly anticipated plans for
Monday's TinkerSocial!

We're going to be having a scavenger crawl, a scavenger hunt combined
with a pub crawl. We'll be starting in Origins at 1800hrs, and
finishing sometime around 2300 (or whenever you want to duck out).

Did I mention there were prizes? Nice prizes. Prizes so good you want
to come along just to find out what they are. Maybe.
