Our next event is Soldering 101/Wearable Electronics #2, which will take place in the Jennison Building (Electronics) Project Labs this Monday (16th) at 18:00.

Soldering 101 is kinda like our early Christmas celebration as we will teach you how to solder a circuit that looks like a christmas tree and has flashing LEDs! Come along if youâ€™d like to learn how to use a soldering iron and/or if you are feeling festive, although it is a bit early...

We will also continue playing with conductive thread and the bits and pieces from the previous wearable electronics workshop so come along if you want to finish your wearable projects.

As you will be taking these kits back home with you, we will have to charge you 2 pounds for the christmas tree and a battery. Normally you would have to pay around 4 quid for the bundle if you got it straight from Rapid but we will be taking care of the difference from our Union budget.  Kit fees can be paid to Em on the day.

We have limited kit available so we kindly ask you to sign up for a spot here if you would like to attend the event:<a href="http://tinkersoc.eventwax.com/soldering-101-christmas-edition" target="_blank"> http://tinkersoc.eventwax.com/soldering-101-christmas-edition</a>

YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOOK A TICKET IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON YOUR WEARABLE ELECTRONICS PROJECT! (And it won't cost you a penny to attend this session!)
