Our first session will be held this Monday, meeting in <a title="KS4" href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/ettoffice/rooms/room.html?room=KS4">KS4</a>Â (A seminar
room in Keynes, don't worry, we'll put up signs) at 6.00pm.

We will be playing with conductive PlayDoh to teach the basics of
circuitry and electronics, and we'll be giving you a brief into to the
society and its committee.
