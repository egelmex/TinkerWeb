Merry Christmas Tinkerers!

This coming Monday we'll be spreading festive (and glowy) cheer
throughout campus in our Christmas CampusMod event in the spirit of
our very successful Freshers Mayhem. We'll be decorating the campus
trees and social areas with custom-made TinkerSoc LED gadgets and have
a good laugh at the time.

This will be the last TinkerSoc event of the term, so make sure you
come along and be merry before heading home for Christmas!

This event will start at around 1800hrs in the Rutherford Common Room,
rather than Keynes as usual, so make sure you come to the right place.

Remember, Rutherford Common Room at 6. See you there!
