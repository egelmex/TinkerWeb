The first OpenLab session will be happening tomorrow (26th January 2009) at 1815 until 2015, in the Electronics Department Project Lab.  If you want to attend, turn up outside the Electronics Department (by the binary clock) and give us a ring on <strong>01227 808 199</strong> and we'll let you in.

If you're wondering what you might do at the OpenLab session, then how about giving the <a href="http://ukctinker.org/wiki/altoids">Altoids Tin competition</a> a go?  There will be people on hand to run your ideas past, as well as the resources to get your project off to a good start.

Hope to see you there!
