Next week we will be having our introduction to Arduino workshop.

Arduino is a physical computing platform based on a simple open hardware design for a single-board microcontroller, with embedded I/O support and a standard programming language (which is essentially simplified C/C++).

In Monday's workshop we will teach you the basics of embedded computing, talking about key concepts and applications and introduce you to the Arduino hardware/software.

We will have this workshop back in KLSR4 at 1800 this coming Monday (23rd November).

Also, the photos from this weeks workshop should be available soon.

See you there!
