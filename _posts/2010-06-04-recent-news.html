Hello all! 
I hope exams are going well for you, and wish those of you unlucky few, (like me) with plenty still to go, lots of luck!

Well this week Chris and I went to the delightful Societies Federation meeting. Nothing really to report~ a few new societies ratified, and more vague hints towards the new website societies are being promised. We'll let you know more on that front when we know, but it should be the end for OnCampus (hurrah I hear you cry). 

There was also a meeting of old and new committee members. We decided on an official handover date of the last day of term (18th June) and started planning some exciting new events for the year to come! So watch this space everyone, and in the meantime keep tinkering!
