This week we had our introduction to the Arduino, and in next week's session we will be be going a bit more in-depth to tell you how to interface with the chip.

We will cover how to connect your computer to your
Arduino, your Arduino to the network, your doorbell to your Arduino to your computer, your website to your Arduino to your room lights...

This workshop will be held in KLSR4 at 1800 hrs on Monday the 30th of November.

See you there!
