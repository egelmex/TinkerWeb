In the continuing effort to re-establish amateur radio at the University of Kent Canterbury,
[The Shed](http://cs.kent.ac.uk/makerspace) (the School of Computingâ€™s makerspace) applied to the [RSGB](http://rsgb.org/) for the university to become a registered examination center. Today, we have found out that the application was successful.

This means that students and staff of the university, who are interested in pursuing the hobby can now sit the required examinations on campus and if successful, achieve their licenses.

As part of this, TinkerSoc are planning to set a date for an examination to be held during the first quarter of this new year; with practical training (for foundation level) through January to March.  If you are interested in obtaining your foundation license, or even taking the next step (to intermediate), then please email us at <contact@tinkersoc.org>.
