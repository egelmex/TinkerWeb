<h3>Next Week</h3>
<div>This Monday at 6.00pm in KS14 we're hosting our second OpenMic of the year, and we have a list of talks including topics such as a home-made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keytar" target="_blank">Keytar</a>, a <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/" target="_blank">MakerBot</a> and a computer controlled Lego railway. If you were eager to talk about something, please tell us! We always have room for an extra talk</div>
<h3>Coming weeks</h3>
<div>The week after we are going to be holding a pub social, where we'll be going to be taking you to a couple of our favourite pubs in town.</div>
<h3>Other stuff</h3>
<div>Hoodies! So far we only have a few hoodie orders, if you want one get your order in as soon as possible! Go to our page <a href="http://www.kentunion.co.uk/organisation/TinkerSoc/" target="_blank">here</a> to order, and then to <a href="http://goo.gl/Z8l9e" target="_blank">this form</a> to tell me how you want it personalised.</div>
