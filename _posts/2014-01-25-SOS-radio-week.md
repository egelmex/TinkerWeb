The SOS Radio Week is an annual week of fund raising by amature radio
enthusiasts to ain the  [Royal National Lifeboat
Institution](http://www.rnli.org.uk/) (RNLI) and has raised over £15,000 for
the institution in the past 5 years.  On Saturday 25th January 2014 some
members of TinkerSoc joined [Hilderstone Amateur Radio and Electronics
club](www.g0hrs.org/) at Ramsgate Lifeboat Station to help with the event by
making contacts, and to practice in preparation for taking their foundation
license exam at the beginning of February.

Operating under the special event call sign on GB1RLS on the 40m band and
transmitting using a hand tuned dipole antenna we talked to over 50 other
enthusiasts from all across the UK, and beyond.
