## Next week ##
I promised a wearable electronics for this Monday coming, but alas, there
has been a change of plan. We will, instead, be running a joint **pumpkin
carving** and simple **circuitry** session. So, no need to bring a t-shirt
to ruin. Same time (6.00pm), same place (KS14).

## Next Month ##

After the pumpkin carving and circuitry evening we will be running our second OpenMic of the year. We already have a few volunteers giving talks, but please get in touch if you have something awesome to share with us.

## Hoodies! ##
