On Thursday 3rd July 2014, three Members of [TinkerSoc](http://www.tinkersoc.org]
travelled to Broadstairs to join members of the [Hilderstone Amateur Radio and
Electronics club](http://www.g0hrs.org/) in sitting their Intermediate Amature Radio
licence.  Over the past 4 months they have taken part in an web based course to learn the theory behind RF circuit design and operation. 
This course culminated in projects such as laser tag guns and morse code transcievers being built.
They all completed the exam successfully and are now eligible to
operate equipment, with a power rating up to and including 50 watts, and also design and build their own radio equipment!

The members should soon recieve certificates through the post from the [Radio Society of Great
Britain](http://rsgb.org/) and will be choosing their Intermediate Callsign via OfCom’s [Services
Site](https://services.ofcom.org.uk). 

The next step our members can take is to work towards their advanced licence, enabling operators up to 400 watts of power and the the ability to supervise and teach un-licenced operators.
