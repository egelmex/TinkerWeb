{% picture freshers-tinkersoc.jpg %}
Thanks to everyone that stopped by and had a look at the TinkerSoc stand at fresher's fayre, we had a lot of fun, and we hope the Furby's were interesting. Our first meeting of the term will be on Wednesday the 2nd of October, and we'll be doing a real life Angry birds game! We hope to see you all there!

For those interested in how the furbys were controlled, we'll be writing up a report shortly. Watch this space! In the mean time, we post interesting maker things regularly to [Facebook](http://facebook.com/tinkersoc/) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tinkersoc/), so come like/follow us if you've not already.

If you have any questions, they can be directed to the committee over facebook, or email. See the [Contact Us]({{site.url}}/resources/contact.html) page for more details on how to do that.
