Now that the obligatory geeky title is out of the way, I would like to thank
all of you for making TinkerSoc a great society. If we didn't have you guys,
the members, coming along and taking part it would be much less fun.

This year was great for TinkerSoc, we really got back to our roots in
electronic tinkering. Hopefully at least some of you have learnt something and
that some of you are inspired to tinker in your own free time.

As of yesterday the committee has changed hands, with Em, Mex and myself
stepping down. Your new committee now know everything that we do (at least),
and are ready to start next year off with a bang. Next  years committee are:

 * **Jack Cannon** - President
 * **Dan Knox** - Treasurer
 * **William Duyck**  - Secretary

On behalf of myself and the other members of this years committee: Good bye,
and thanks!

Matt
