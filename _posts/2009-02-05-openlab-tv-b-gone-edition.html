The next OpenLab will be on Monday 16th February (starting at 17:00), and, due to popular demand, this time we have a plan.

We will be providing you with all the component parts for a TV-B-Gone, and you can use the lab facilities to put it all together - or you can use the parts to build something completely different! It's all up to you. There will be plenty of knowledgeable people around to help out should you get stuck.

We might even go out and use our creations to wreak some havoc in a campus bar after we're done!

All you need to bring is yourself and some enthusiasm. Some cash for pizza would also be handy.
