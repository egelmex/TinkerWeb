TinkerSoc were at [GEEK2014](http://www.geek2014.co.uk/) this weekend showing
off some of our projects, including some of the 3D printers we have been
working on with the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/).  Our
stall was well received, especially Dan's laser engraver, and to top of the
weekend we saved the day and fixed the punch the custard via our knowledge of
Arduinos!
