[B&amp;K Precision](http://www.bkprecision.com/) have kindly donated some
awesome kit to TinkerSoc all the way from America. We will be teaching you how
to use this equipment in our headphone amp project (more details of which will
be announced in the new term), and then they will be available for members to
use.

We would like to send our warmest thanks to 
[B&amp;K Precision](http://www.bkprecision.com/) as we would never have been able to
afford such awesome equipment from our budget.
