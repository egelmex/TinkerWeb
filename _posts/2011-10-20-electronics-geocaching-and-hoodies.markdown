Hi Everybody,
Congratulations to our two winners from our Bottle Rocket Social! The other scores are at <a href="http://tinkersoc.org/2011/10/bottle-rocket-scores">http://tinkersoc.org/2011/10/bottle-rocket-scores</a>, have a look to see how you did.
<h3>Saturday</h3>
This Saturday we will be GeoCaching! Have a look at the email from Mex for more info. Spaces are tight, but if you're interested please get in touch with <a href="mailto:martin@tinkersoc.org">martin@tinkersoc.org</a>.
<h3>Monday</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back to electronics next week with Breadboarding 101 in KS14 at 6.00pm on Monday as usual. Breadboarding is a circuit prototyping method, and can be used to experiment with different circuits, components and designs. We're going to be using breadboards to teach you a few circuits to develop your electronics knowledge.

Remember, you need to be a member to attend this session, but if you haven't yet attended a session and want to see what we're about please get in touch with a committee member (<a href="mailto:contact@tinkersoc.org">contact@tinkersoc.org</a>).</p>

<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
The week after we will be holding our wearable electronic workshop where you'll be able to put the skills learnt in Breadboarding 101 to use! If you have an old t-shirt that you don't mind damaging you'll want to bring it along!
<h3>Hoodies</h3>
We're going to be ordering society hoodies! Current costs are £20 (+£2 if you want it personalised), with a small amount going towards the societies running costs. Not only will it keep you warm in geeky fashion it will also help your society! Win win! :)

If you want fill in our form at <a href="http://goo.gl/Z8l9e">http://goo.gl/Z8l9e</a> and we'll get back to you when we have enough orders.
