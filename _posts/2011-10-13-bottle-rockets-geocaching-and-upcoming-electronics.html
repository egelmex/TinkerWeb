Happy Thursday everyone!
<div>Hopefully you all enjoyed the OpenMic this week, thankfully we've already heard that a few of you want to give a presentation next time which will make it even better.</div>
<h3>Next Week</h3>
<img class="aligncenter" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Bottle Rocket" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Launchbottle.jpg/220px-Launchbottle.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="272" />
<div>This Monday at 6.00pm in KS14 we will be starting our Bottle Rocket Social. We will be spending a short while customising our rockets in KS14 and then promptly heading out to a grassy expanse of land and launching them. Once our highly customised rockets have been sent in to space we'll be heading to the nearest bar to start the social proper.</div>
<div>If you have one spare bring an empty 2 litre bottle to use as a rocket, we should have enough to go round but I wouldn't leave it chance!</div>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<div>The Saturday after next (22nd October) we will be organising half a day of Geocaching. More details to follow from Mex, so keep your eyes on your inboxes!</div>
<div><img class="aligncenter" title="Breadboards!" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Breadboard.JPG/450px-Breadboard.JPG" alt="No sandwiches here :(" width="315" height="420" /></div>
<div>We are also nearing the next four-week rotation, and will be starting by teaching the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard" target="_blank">breadboarding</a>, and using that knowledge in the next week to create wearable electronics. Breadboarding is a method of testing out circuit design without having to worry about solder, so it's perfect for the classroom!</div>
