TinkerSoc is going to be hosting a learn-to-solder Session at this
year's [BarCamp Canterbury](http://barcampcanterbury.com/). For those
who are unfamilar with BarCamp: BarCamp is an **unconference** that is
a completely **free** to attend and based loosely around the theme of
**technology**.

There are only a few kits, and they will be sold on a first come,
first serve basis, at £7 each.

We hope to see you at BarCamp!
