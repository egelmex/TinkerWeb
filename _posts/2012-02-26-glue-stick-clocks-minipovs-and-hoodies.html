Hi Everyone,

This Monday we're running a practical session making clocks out of glue gun sticks and LEDs, see you in the Simulation Lab in Jennison at 6.00pm.

For the two weeks after we're going to be making a circuit called a miniPOV, a small board that you can spin around to make text appear in mid air.

Also, still waiting on the hoodies, sorry. We'll let you know as soon as we know anything.

See you Monday!

Matt
