This week we looked at controlling servos over serial using the arduino.

We started by making the servos move, by learning how to control them from
Arduino.

We then played around with the serial library for arduino and then learnt what
classes, methods and variables were. We used the arduino to compare bytes of
data coming in over serial to characters we'd defined in the program.

Once we had done this we put the two together, and hey-presto: serial
controlled servos.

I've put the googledoc presentaion up here
