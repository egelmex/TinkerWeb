The logo competiton will be coming to a close this coming Thursday (29th January), so if you want to submit an entry then get your skates on!  The current winning (and only ...) entry is this:
<img src="http://ukctinker.org/wiki/_media/tinkersoc_draft_small.png?cache=cache&w=500&h=97" alt="TinkerSoc Logo" />

If you think you can do better, submit your entry to the <a href="http://ukctinker.org/wiki/logo">logo competition wiki page</a> before Thursday.
