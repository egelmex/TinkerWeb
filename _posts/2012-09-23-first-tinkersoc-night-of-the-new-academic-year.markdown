Hey everyone, our first society night will be on Monday 24th of September at
7Pm in Keynes KS14. This first meeting is free to everyone and anyone is
welcome to attend.

We shall have a quick introduction of the new committee team and chat about our
plans for the society this year. You can also collect your Laser'd Keychain
thingie at this event as well. We shall also build some quick spud cannons in
preparation for our first social, Potato Archery, before heading off to the
K-Bar to get to know each other better.

So new and old members, come along for some fun!

Dan
