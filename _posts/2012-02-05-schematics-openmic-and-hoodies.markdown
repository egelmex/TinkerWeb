This Monday at 6.00pm in the Sim Lab as usual we will be running a
schematics workshop. We will teach you about and give you hands on
experience drawing schematics and fixing broken circuits.

The week after (Monday 13th) we are going to be holding another OpenMic
session - if you have any great new projects to talk about please get in
touch!

Also, the hoodies. There are currently issues with the payment getting from
Kent Union to the hoodie people. I will let you know once we know more,
sorry. :(

Cheers,

Matt
