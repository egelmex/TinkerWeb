<h2>This Monday</h2>
This coming Monday will be the first OpenLab of the year! We're going
to be starting an ongoing robotics project, so make sure you come
along. The OpenLab will take place in the Electronics Lab in the
Jennison Building at 1800hrs, we hope to see you there.
<h2>TinkerFest</h2>
As most of you know we have been planning an event called TinkerFest,
a competitive day of tinkering. Before we confirm to undertaking the
event, we need to know that there is interest. If you want to take
part in it make sure you tell us! If we don't get a good response,
sadly, it won't be happening. So please, if you are interested, email
me.
<h2>Maker Faire</h2>
Maker Faire is a two day event that celebrates tinkering, innovation
and creativity, and will be coming to Newcastle in March. It is a
great chance to see other tinkerers projects from all over the
country. We know that some TinkerSoc members are planning to go along,
so if you want to go along speak to us or drop us an email.
