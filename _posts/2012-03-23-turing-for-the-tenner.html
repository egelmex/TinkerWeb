A <a title="Turing for the tenner" href="https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/31659">petition</a> has been started to discuss the possibility of putting Alan Turing on the new face of the £10 note.

Turing is considered to be the father of computer science, and worked on breaking the Enigma code during WWII. As engineers and computer scientists (and even just as users of computers in general) we owe him a great deal.

If you agree that this national hero deserves a place on the £10 note, you should sign this <a title="Turing for the tenner" href="https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/31659">petition</a>.
