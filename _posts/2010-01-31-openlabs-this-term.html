Greetings tinkerers,

Starting tomorrow, we will be having the OpenLab sessions every Monday in the Jennison Building Project Labs to make/break/hack stuff and have fun during the process!

Join us tomorrow to discuss our plans to modify an RC car to do awesome stuff.

6PM, Jennison Building. See you there!
