Wow!  That was quick!  The OpenLab TV-B-Gone slots for kits has already been filled!

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">However, if you're still interested in getting a kit, then add yourself to the <a href="http://ukctinker.org/wiki/openlab:tvbgone">waiting list on the wiki </a>.  If you put down some kind of contact detail, I'll get back to you if you've got a kit available.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We've now got 20 slots available, so get your <a href="http://ukctinker.org/wiki/openlab:tvbgone">name down on the wiki</a> if you want a kit!</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Only add yourself if you're definitely free on <strong>Monday 16th February between 1700 and 2000</strong>.</span>

No, seriously, now all 20 slots have been filled.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
