Due to some unforseen circumstances, including illness and beginning
of term room booking craziness, we had to cancel the intro meeting
this Monday (boo).  BUT we have now rearranged the room booking, and
I'm pleased to announce the time and location of the NEW intro
meeting!

KLSR4, from 1800 on Monday 5th October
<a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/ettoffice/rooms/room.html?room=KLSR4"> Location</a>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Directions:</span>

If you go into Keynes through the glass doors at the front, go right.
Go past the reception (in a glass box) and then turn left.  Just
before you reach the stairs, turn left and you should be standing in
front of the door to KLSR4.

In this meeting we're going to cover:
<ul>
	<li>Introduction to TinkerSoc</li>
	<li> Who we are</li>
	<li> What we do</li>
	<li>How to join</li>
</ul>
Since we're a little behind, we'll give you a quick runthough of
Processing and how we managed to build spiroID in terms of the
software.  Nothing too hardcore (since it's an intro meeting), and for
about 15-20 minutes.

Once we've done that, we'll probably head to K-bar for a drink and chat!

Hope to see you there!
