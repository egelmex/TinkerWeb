Hey everyone,

For those of you who just discovered TinkerSoc, a warm welcome first of all, and a quick note to say we have some pretty cool things planned for the new academic year, so stay tuned!

If you want to keep track of our updates, add our RSS feed to your reader or find us on twitter (@tinkersoc)

We will have a booth in the Societies Fayre, which should be happening on the 24th so pop in, say hi and see what we have planned for you :)

Looking forward to meeting you all!
