On Thursday 6th February 2014, Members of [TinkerSoc](http://www.tinkersoc.org]
travelled to Broadstairs to join members of the [Hilderstone Amateur Radio and
Electronics club](http://www.g0hrs.org/) to sit their Foundation Amateur Radio
license.  The members have been working towards their license for approximately
4 months and everyone passed with flying colours and are now eligible to
operate equipment of power up to and including 10 watts and building and
operating commercial kits (below the 10W power limit).

Now that the members have passed they should have
recieved their certificates through the post from the [Radio Society of Great
Britain](http://rsgb.org/) and can apply for a callsign via OfCom’s [Services
Site](https://services.ofcom.org.uk). 

The next step for the new amateurs is to work on their Intermediate License if
they want, this enables operators up to 50 watts of power and the ability to
design and build their own equipment.
