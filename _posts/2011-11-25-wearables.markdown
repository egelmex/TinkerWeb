Last week's session (tapeÂ sculptures) went well, our monstrosity of a
creation even made it to reddit!

## Next Week ##

This Monday at 6.00pm in KS14 we are going to be running our rescheduled
wearables electronics workshop (unless a vital component doesn't appear, in
which case we'll do something equally fun)! Please bring along some old
clothes you're willing to modifier, or failing that we do have a few hats
that you can work on.

## Coming Weeks ##

The week after we will be having an OpenMic session. There are still free
slots for speakers, so send us you talk ideas! The wider the range of talks
the better.

## Important Info ##

 * **6.00pm on Monday, KS14** Wearables
 * Send in your OpenMic talks
 * Further information on hoodies coming soon, we're waiting on our supplier.

Cheers,

Matt
