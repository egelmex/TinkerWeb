TinkerSoc is a society for people who like to see the potential of technology and through experimentation come up with awesome new applications, often beyond the original intended use!

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3289480406_c503491350.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>

Some areas of interest are robots, tiny computers, audio/visual installations, interactive displays and pretty much any new technology that we can use for fun, creativity and self-expression. We hope to have equal parts of both art and engineering.

It is for people who love to share their creativity with like minded people, and collaborate in designs and projects that are, simply, awesome. Having people from a variety of different backgrounds gives us the chance to look at problems from various different perspectives. We welcome everyone from every discipline, whether you are a Law student or an engineer we can guarantee you will learn something new and have fun in our events!

To get a better understanding of what we do, have a look at our [calendar page](/calendar/) for upcoming events and socials!


We encourage all our members and potential members to be part of the society and help decide what kind of events and activities are run, and how we run them. So if you have any questions or comments, [Please get in touch](/Contact).
