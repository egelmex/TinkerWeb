# The Committee Positions #

All student groups within [Kent Union](http://www.kentunion.co.uk) are operated
by democratically elected committees of students.

The [TinkerSoc Committee](http://www.tinkersoc.org/resources/committee.html)
consists of voting executive officers, voting officers, and non-voting officers
as well.

The executive positions are **President, Secretary and Treasurer**. These are
the minimum 3 positions required by Kent Union. Executive officers are elected
by the society at a General Meeting (GM) and are directly responsible for the
running of the society.

New to the society are the officer positions, *Comms officer and Media
officer*. These may become additional voting officers, elected by the society
at a GM. These positions tend to relate speciality to support the society and
its activities.

Non-voting officers are not elected by the society and so have no vote in
committee meetings. These positions tend to be held by people who want to help
run the society or activities.
