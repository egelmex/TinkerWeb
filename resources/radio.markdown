## History
We did have a Amateur Radio Society club which was run
by the students which was very successful through the 70s and 80s up
to about 1995.
 
It's popularity declined after 1995 and then it was very difficult to
get the 15 students to sign up, that the student union required to
form the club.

In 1999 the Radio shack, that was located just east of the old Oast
House, was demolished to make way for the building of Stock Court.

## Now
TinkerSoc has been working with the 
[Hilderstone Radio club](http://www.g0hrs.org/pages/go.php) to get a
radio group running on campus again. We're getting our members to
obtain foundation amateur radio licences, and are looking into finding
radio equiptment to use!

There are 3 licenses available in the UK, each builds on the last.

- [Foundation License](http://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/fees/) (exam cost: £27.50)
    - Allowed up to 10 watts of radio output
    - May not build own equiptment
    - May build equiptment from aproved kits
- [Intermediate License](http://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/fees/) (exam cost: £37.50)
    - Allowed up to 50 watts of output 
    - May build own equiptment
- [Advanced License](http://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/fees/) (exam cost: £47.50)
    - Allowed up to 400 watts of output
    - May apply to use other bands

## Ofcom

Radio licencing is controller by [Ofcom](http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/amateur-radio/)
 in the UK. They are who you need to apply to to keep your radio 
licence up-to-date, and who will provide your call sign.

If you are going to get your radio licence, you need to create an
account and choose a call sign (for foundation you will have something
like M0XYZ where you can choose the XYZ, if it is free.

Once you have chosen this, you need to attach proof of your
examination, when aproved you will be free to use your new callsign in
the ways allowed!
