# Borrowing Kit #
You can borrow stuff from us for your personal projects. Just get in

# Group Orders #

We are planning to do monthly batch orders from Farnell and Rapid Electronics,
two major suppliers with minimum order restrictions. More info

# T.G.S.B.O.E.J #

In the spirit of [The Great Internet Migratory Box Of Electronics
Junk](http://tgimboej.org/Main_Page) we started the "TinkerSoc's Great Static
Box of Electronic Junk" and it is pretty awesome (and static). Get in touch if
you're interested!

# Presentation Materials #

We have a [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/tinkersoc) account,
though we currently don't update it with slides from each week. If
you'd like a copy of slides from any week we can either email them to
you or add them to [our blog](/2013/10/Introduction-to-arduino/).
