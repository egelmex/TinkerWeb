We have a number of things, like Arduino boards and electronic bits and bobs you may want to use in your personal projects and we think it's cool -- as long as you don't break them! :)

Discuss your needs with one of the committee members and if we don't have any scheduled workshops/events that will need the use of that certain piece of equipment they will be happy to lend it to you.

A list of equipment you can borrow will appear here someday, until then get in touch to discuss requirements.
