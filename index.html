#TinkerSoc#
##Kent University's Maker Society##

Tinkersoc is the society where we build, hack and (sometimes) blow things up.
Tinkersoc is not just about electronics, although we do like our fair share of
LEDS, it is a society that embraces all forms of technology, engineering and
craft.

So, if you have an interest in: building your own tube amp, getting a
radio license, high powered burning lasers or you just want to learn design
and solder a circuit.  Then this is the society for you!

It is for people who love to share their creativity with like minded people,
and collaborate in designs and projects that are, simply, awesome. Having
people from a variety of different backgrounds gives us the chance to look at
problems from various different perspectives. We welcome everyone from every
discipline, whether you are a Law student or an engineer we can guarantee you
will learn something new and have fun in our events!
