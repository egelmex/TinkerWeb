#TinkerSoc#
##Kent University's Maker Society##

Tinkersoc is the society where we build, hack and (sometimes) blow things up. Tinkersoc is not just about electronics, although we do like our fair share of LEDS, it is a society that embraces all forms of technology, engineering and craft.So, if you have an interest in: building your own tube amp, getting a radio license, high powered burning lasers or you just want to learn design and solder a circuit.This is the society for you!
